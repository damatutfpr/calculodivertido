Um exemplo típico é a função velocidade \r\n            que representa a taxa de variação (derivada) da função espaço. Do mesmo modo, a \r\n            função aceleração é a derivada da função velocidade. Geometricamente, a derivada no \r\n            ponto x=a de y = f(x) representa a inclinação da reta tangente ao gráfico desta \r\n            função no ponto (a,~f(a)).[1][2] A função que a cada ponto x associa a derivada neste \r\n            ponto de f(x) é chamada de função derivada de f(x).</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>fonte: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivada</p>\r\n        <a href=\"#/topics\" id=\"button\">\r\n            <span>Voltar</span>\r\n        </a>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'Derivada'\r\n}\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n#content {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0px;\r\n    left: 0px;\r\n    background-position: 50% 50%;\r\n    background-color: aquamarine;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#title{\r\n    font-family: \"Comic Sans MS\", cursive, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#button {\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    margin-top: 10%;\r\n    -webkit-border-radius: 8px;\r\n    -moz-border-radius: 8px;\r\n    border-radius: 8px;\r\n    -webkit-box-shadow:    0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 15px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, .35);\r\n    -moz-box-shadow: 0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 15px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, .35);\r\n    box-shadow: 0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 15px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, .35);\r\n    -webkit-transition: -webkit-box-shadow .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    -moz-transition: -moz-box-shadow .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    -o-transition: -o-box-shadow .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    transition: box-shadow .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    font-size: 25px;\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n#button span {\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    padding: 10px 20px;\r\n    background-color: #4286f4;\r\n    -webkit-border-radius: 8px;\r\n    -moz-border-radius: 8px;\r\n    border-radius: 8px;\r\n    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, .15);\r\n    -moz-box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, .15);\r\n    box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, .15);\r\n    font-family: \"Comic Sans MS\", cursive, sans-serif;\r\n    line-height: 1;\r\n    text-shadow: 0 -1px 1px rgba(175, 49, 95, .7);\r\n    -webkit-transition: background-color .2s ease-in-out, -webkit-transform .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    -moz-transition: background-color .2s ease-in-out, -moz-transform .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    -o-transition: background-color .2s ease-in-out, -o-transform .1s ease-in-out;\r\n    transition: background-color .2s ease-in-out, transform .1s ease-in-out;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#button:hover span {\r\n    background-color: #4286f4;\r\n    text-shadow: 0 -1px 1px rgba(175, 49, 95, .9), 0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, .8);\r\n}\r\n#button:active, #button:focus {\r\n    -webkit-box-shadow:    0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 12px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);\r\n    -moz-box-shadow: 0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 12px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);\r\n    box-shadow:    0 8px 0 #4286f4, 0 12px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#button:active span {\r\n    -webkit-transform: translate(0, 4px);\r\n    -moz-transform: translate(0, 4px);\r\n    -o-transform: translate(0, 4px);\r\n    transform: translate(0, 4px);\r\n}\r\np{\r\n    font-family: \"Comic Sans MS\", cursive, sans-serif;  \r\n}\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/Learn/Derivada.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"learn-topics\"}},[_c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"content\"}},[_c('h1',{attrs:{\"id\":\"title\"}},[_vm._v(\"Integral\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"No cálculo, a integral de uma função foi criada originalmente para determinar a \\n          área sob uma curva no plano cartesiano e também surge naturalmente em dezenas de \\n          problemas da física, como por exemplo na determinação da posição em todos os \\n          instantes de um objeto, se for conhecida a sua velocidade instantânea em todos os \\n          instantes.\\n          Diferentemente da noção associada de derivação, existem várias definições para a integração,\\n          todas elas visando a resolver alguns problemas conceituais relacionados a limites, \\n          continuidade e existência de certos processos utilizados na definição.
